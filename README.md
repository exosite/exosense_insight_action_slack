# ExoSense™ Insight How-To Guide

## Basic Concepts

ExoSense™ Insights are processes that act on Asset Signals within the
application. They allow customers to integrate in a flexible way with a wide
array of internal and external services to provide analytics, decision, and
action capabilities. Correspondingly, there are three types of Insights:

* Transforms
* Rules
* Actions

Fundamentally, all Insights are:

### Streaming

* At their core, Insights are not stateful; similar to other
  Transformations like Join and Linear Gain, they operate on a single piece of
  Signal data.
* For a given Join on SignalA and SignalB, each time a piece of
  data comes in from _either_ of those Signals, the Join runs (and returns a
  joined value).
* The Join Transform uses the last seen value of any Signal not
  present in the data sent to the Join at any given time.

### Exchange Elements

* From the ExoSense and Murano perspective, an Insight is an ExoSense specific service and must use the element tag  `insight`in the swagger defintion.
    ```yaml
    tags:
      - name: insight
        description: Insight Module
    ```
* The Swagger definition for the Service is found in this repository:
  [insight-template.yaml](./insight-template.yaml). Use
  [swagger.io](https://editor.swagger.io/) to view the incoming and outgoing
  data format.

### Webservers

* The Exchange Service created for an Insight defines the URL
  to be requested when ExoSense needs to do any of the following:
    * get high-level information about the Insight
    * get a list of available functions for a group, along with their
      required parameters
    * get info about a specific function, along with its required parameters
    * process incoming Signal data (i.e. "run the function")
* This URL can be hosted anywhere, including:
    * Murano
    * Amazon Web Services
    * Microsoft Azure
    * Google Cloud Products

### Services

* The code behind the Insight is entirely up to its creator; as long as it
  conforms to the Swagger definition, ExoSense will happily send and receive
  data from it.
* The code that makes up an Insight can be written in any language available
  within the chosen host.

## Enabling Within ExoSense

To enable an Insight within ExoSense:
1. Create an Asset and add Signals to that Asset.
1. Click the [+] button next to a Signal
1. Under "Type", select the Insight you created. The displayed name is the
  "name" value returned by a GET /info request.
1. Enter a valid Group ID (e.g. "80000001").
1. Select the desired Function (e.g. "Add Numbers").
1. Select a signal from the Input Signal 1 dropdown
1. Supply a number to add to the chosen Signal in the Parameters section
  (e.g. "adder")
1. Supply a name, type, and unit for the output signal.
1. Click save.

## Requirements

1. Customized Swagger file (template is
  [insight-template.yaml](./insight-template.yaml)). The only sections that
  should be modified are:
    * info
    * host
    * basePath (in many cases the host URL is sufficient and this should be
      left as "/")
1. URL to that Swagger file (e.g. by using Gist, and copying the URL from the
  "raw" view)
1. HTTP service with correct endpoints, as defined in the
  [insight-template.yaml](./insight-template.yaml) file.
    * `get /info`

      This endpoint is used to get high-level information about an Insight.
      The name displayed within the ExoSense UI, the Insight description, and
      whether or not a `group_id` is required are supplied via this endpoint.

    * `get /insight/{fn}`

      This endpoint is used to get all the necessary information about a
      specific Function, including:
        * Description
        * Input Signals (inlets)
        * Output Signals (outlets)
        * User-Supplied Constants

    * `post /insights`

      This endpoint is used to supply a list of Functions (and their
      info/requirements/meta-data) available to a specific Group (supplied as a
      Group ID)

    * `post /process`

      This endpoint is used to process Signal data and return a new Signal(s)
1. Exchange Service beginning with the word "Insight" and using the Swagger
  file URL.
1. Exchange Service added to your Business.
1. Exchange Service added to your ExoSense Instance.

## Examples

### Murano Example

#### Swagger File

Modify the info, host, and basePath sections of the Swagger template:
```yaml
swagger: "2.0"

info:
  version: "1.0"
  title: My Demo Insight
  description: |
    This demo Insight is a Functional Module that can be publsihed in Exosite's IoT Exchange
    and used within ExoSense.
  contact:
    name: Your Name Here
    email: YOU@BIZ.com

host: mydemoinsight.apps.exosite.io # Set this to the host your function is on (Example Custom Murano Hosted App Service, AWS, etc)
basePath: / # Set this or the path according to your function
tags:
  - name: insight
    description: Insight Module
schemes:
  - https  # Only https is supported.
consumes:
  - application/json # Only JSON is supported.
produces:
  - application/json # Only JSON is supported.

[...]
```

#### Public URL

Upload via [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/)
or use [defunkt/gist](https://github.com/defunkt/gist)

#### HTTP Service

1. Create a Murano Application with a reasonable name (e.g. mydemoinsight)
1. Using either Murano in a browser or with
  [MuranoCLI](http://docs.exosite.com/development/tools/murano-cli/),
  create the following API endpoints with the code in examples/murano/routes:
    * `GET /info`
    * `GET /insight/{fn}`
    * `POST /insights`
    * `POST /process`
1. Create the following Module with the code in examples/murano/modules
    * `insightModule`

#### Exchange Service Element

* In Murano, go to IoT Marketplace and click on Publish on the left
* Parameters:
  * Element name: Recommend including 'Insight' in the name.
  * Element type: Service
  * Element Variation: ExoSense Insight
  * Configuration File (YAML) URL: the URL from your public Gist (make sure to copy the URL
    from the "raw" view)
  * ... (fill the rest out as you see fit)

#### Add Insight To Business

Go to the Element you created in IoT Marketplace and add it to your Murano Business.

#### Add Insight To ExoSense

Go to the ExoSense instance Solution in Murano, and click the orange "Enable
Services" button at the top right. Find the Service you just created and enable
it. Your Insight is now available to use in ExoSense! Now, all you need to do is
[create an Insight Transormation in the ExoSense UI](#enabling-within-exosense).
